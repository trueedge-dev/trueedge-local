PROJECT NAME:
TRUEEDGE

ONE-LINE SUMMARY:
TRUEEDGE is a global exchange for trading strategies where every performance number is cryptographically tied to real, live trades — no fake backtests, no edited history.

PROBLEM:
The trading strategy world is full of:
- over-optimized backtests that never work in reality,
- cherry-picked screenshots,
- fake track records,
- “trust me, it works” signals.

Serious traders and investors have no easy way to:
- verify that a strategy actually performed as claimed,
- compare strategies on consistent, honest data,
- allocate capital to real edge instead of marketing.

STRATEGY CREATORS have no clean way to:
- prove their performance without working at a big fund,
- monetize their edge transparently,
- build portable, verifiable track records.

CORE IDEA:
TRUEEDGE defines a standard for “proof-of-performance” and builds a marketplace on top of it.

Every strategy’s live trades are:
- logged in real time,
- signed and hashed (tamper-evident),
- stored in an append-only ledger (e.g. blockchain or verifiable log),
- aggregated into metrics and curves.

When someone views a strategy on TRUEEDGE:
- the equity curves, drawdowns, Sharpe ratios, etc. are calculated from these signed logs,
- not from private spreadsheets or easily faked statements.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1) PERFORMANCE PROOF LAYER
- A specification for “trade events”:
  - time,
  - symbol,
  - direction,
  - size,
  - fill price,
  - fees,
  - strategy ID,
  - account ID (pseudonymous),
  - environment (live/demo).
- A signing + hashing mechanism:
  - strategies or connectors sign event batches,
  - events are hashed and anchored into an append-only structure.
- A verification engine:
  - recomputes metrics from raw events,
  - checks that event history is consistent with hashes.

2) STRATEGY MARKETPLACE
- Strategy creators can:
  - list their strategies with verified performance,
  - choose exposure model:
    - full copy-trading,
    - trade signals only,
    - synthetic indices (bundles of sub-strategies).
  - set pricing:
    - subscriptions,
    - performance fees,
    - licence deals.

- Investors / users can:
  - filter strategies by:
    - instrument, timeframe, risk, max drawdown, Sharpe, etc.,
  - subscribe / allocate to selected strategies,
  - monitor risk in a unified dashboard.

3) PORTFOLIO & RISK LAYER
- Users can build portfolios of strategies:
  - weights per strategy,
  - risk caps,
  - diversification rules.
- The system:
  - tracks portfolio-level metrics,
  - can auto-rebalance based on rules,
  - can pause strategies that breach risk limits.

4) ANALYTICS & TOOLS
- Deep analytics for serious users:
  - regime analysis,
  - exposure by asset class / factor,
  - trade distributions,
  - Monte Carlo resampling,
  - stress tests.
- API for quants:
  - programmatic access to verified trade histories and metrics.

MONEY MODEL (FIRST VERSION):
- Marketplace revenue share:
  - TRUEEDGE takes a percentage of:
    - subscription fees paid to strategy providers,
    - performance-fee flows (where permitted),
    - licence deals.
- Pro analytics subscriptions:
  - extra fee for advanced analytics dashboards and APIs.
- Later: institutional / white-label offers for funds and prop firms.

WHY THIS CAN BE INDUSTRY-LEVEL:
- It solves a real, painful trust problem:
  - separating real edge from noise and fraud.
- If adopted, “TRUEEDGE-verified performance” can become:
  - the default way to present a public track record,
  - a common language for discussing strategies and risk.
- It can connect:
  - independent quants with capital,
  - capital allocators with verifiable edges,
  - all built on transparent, consistent data.

HIGH-LEVEL ROADMAP (SUMMARY):

PHASE 0 – Foundation (now)
- Define vision and basic folder structure (local).
- Specify the core data model for trade events and strategy performance.

PHASE 1 – PROOF CORE (1–3 months)
- Build connectors (starting with demo / paper accounts) that:
  - capture trades,
  - send them to a local TRUEEDGE log service.
- Implement append-only storage and simple signing/hashing.
- Build a basic UI to view:
  - trade history,
  - equity curve,
  - key metrics.

PHASE 2 – CLOUD TRUEEDGE (3–9 months)
- Move logging + metrics to a hosted backend.
- Implement:
  - secure user accounts,
  - strategy identities,
  - verified metrics pages.
- Onboard a small set of early strategies and test users (online only).

PHASE 3 – MARKETPLACE & MONETIZATION (9–24 months)
- Add:
  - subscriptions,
  - performance fee accounting where possible,
  - integrated risk dashboards.
- Start growing the marketplace and community.

PHASE 4 – INSTITUTIONAL & STANDARDIZATION (2+ years)
- Refine the proof standard,
- Approach brokers, platforms, and institutions to:
  - integrate TRUEEDGE proofs,
  - accept TRUEEDGE-style verification as part of due diligence.

TODAY’S FOCUS:
- Create the TRUEEDGE project folder and core subfolders (DONE).
- Create TRUEEDGE_VISION.txt and store this vision inside it.
- Next chunks: define the core trade event format and start designing the local logging prototype.
